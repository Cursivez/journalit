# Privacy Policy - Journalit

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## Overview

Journalit is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your trading data stays in your Obsidian vault, and network features are entirely optional.

---

## Data Storage & Privacy

### Local-First Architecture

The core functionality of Journalit operates **entirely locally** within your Obsidian vault:

- **Trade Notes**: All manually created trade entries are stored only in your vault
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Reviews**: Review notes remain local
- **Account Data**: Account configurations stored in plugin settings
- **Custom Fields & Settings**: All customization data stays local
- **Analytics & Charts**: Calculated locally from your vault data

**No manual trade data is ever transmitted to any server.**

---

## Optional Network Features

Journalit includes optional features that require network connectivity. Backend synchronization is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled in plugin settings.

### MetaTrader 5 Sync (Optional)

When you enable MT5 sync in **Settings → Integration → Backend Integration**, the plugin:

**What is Transmitted:**
- **Only automatically synced trades** from your MetaTrader account
- Trade data: symbol, entry/exit times, prices, position size, P&L
- Account information: MT5 account ID, display name
- Vault identifier: A hashed, non-reversible identifier for sync coordination

**What is NOT Transmitted:**
- Manual trades you create in Obsidian
- Trade notes or analysis you write
- File contents or vault structure
- Personal information beyond account IDs

**Infrastructure:**
- Backend Server (HTTPS)
- FTP Server (for retrieving MT5 trades)
- Data transmission: Encrypted via HTTPS

**Control:**
- Enable/disable in **Settings → Integration → Backend Integration**
- Default: **Enabled** (requires explicit authentication - no data syncs until you log in with email verification)

---

## Network Endpoints

When backend integration is enabled, the plugin communicates with the following endpoints:

- `/api/v1/obsidian/register-vault` - Initial vault registration
- `/api/v1/sync/ftp` - Trigger FTP synchronization
- `/api/v1/trades` - Fetch trade data from backend
- `/api/v1/mt-accounts` - MetaTrader account management
- `/api/v1/obsidian/status` - Check synchronization status
- `/api/v1/ftp-users` - FTP credential management
- `/api/v1/health` - Backend health check

All API requests require JWT authentication via bearer token.

---

## Data Security

### Encryption & Transport
- All network communications use **HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)**
- FTP credentials encrypted by Obsidian's built-in data storage
- Vault identifier is hashed using SHA-256 (non-reversible)

**FTP Credentials**: FTP credentials are automatically generated by the backend server when you enable MT5 sync. These credentials provide access only to your own MetaTrader reports and are isolated from other users through strict access controls.

### Data Retention
- **Synced Trades**: Stored on backend servers for sync functionality
- **Account Mappings**: Stored until you disable MT5 sync

### Third-Party Access
- **No data sharing** with third parties
- **No advertising** or tracking networks
- **No data sales** - your data is never monetized

---

## Your Rights & Control

### Data Access
- All your data is accessible in your Obsidian vault
- Backend synced data available via sync status in settings

### Data Deletion
- **Local Data**: Delete by removing the plugin or deleting files
- **Backend Data**: Contact support@journalit.co to request deletion

### Opt-Out
- MT5 Sync: Disable in **Settings → Backend Integration**
